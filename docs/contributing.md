### Submit and issue or idea

If something doesn't seem quite right or something is missing from the book, please [raise an issue via the GitHub repository](https://github.com/practicalli/spacemacs/issues){target=_blank} explaining in as much detail as you can.

### Considering a Pull request?

Before investing any time in a pull request, please raise an issue explaining the situation.  This can save you and the maintainer time and avoid rejected pull requests.

Please keep pull requests small and focused, as they are much quicker to review and easier to accept.  Ideally PR's should be for a specific page or at most a section.

A PR with a list of changes across different sections will not be merged, it will be reviewed and changes merged eventually.

<!-- TODO:  Add GitHub issue templates, similar to those on practicalli/blog-content -->


## Contributing to Spacemacs

The [Spacemacs contribution guidelines](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.org){target=_blank} details how to get help, report issues and contribute to the project.

`SPC h I` to raise an issue on the [Spacemacs GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues){target=_blank}, automatically including your Spacemacs and Operating system details.

Please review issues and leave feedback, especially confirming issues are reproducible on your Spacemacs configuration. `SPC h d s` to include your system configuration.

Contribute changes via pull requests:
1. Fork the Spacemacs project on GitHub and clone your fork
2. Create a new branch from the `develop` branch (`SPC g s` for magit status, `b c` to create a new branch)
3. Make changes and update relevant README files and the CHANGELOG.develop file
4. Commit changes to the new branch and push to your fork.
5. Visit your fork on GitHub and create a pull request (or [setup forge](source-control/forge-configuration.md) and create PR from Magit)
